  		<h1><b>About the Mahabharata</b></h1>
		</div>
      
   		<p class="indent">The Mahabharata is one of India's most prestigious epics, its phenomenal stories never heard before. The itihasa (meaning history, which is what the book is about) was first recited at a snake-sacrifice by a student of Vyasa (the author). The series of over 100,000 verses is all about dharma (moral law). It is unbelievably seven times as long as Homer's Illiad and Odyssey combined. Divided into 18 parvans (sections), the Mahabharata revolves around the ancient world between 400BCE-200CE. Being the 2nd Sanskrit (Sanskrit was the ancient Indic language) epic poem, the text is about two groups of descendants fighting for the throne's rights for Hastinapura (an ancient city).</p>

			
	 		 <h3><b>Vyasa:The author</b></h3>
		
		
  			<p class="indent"> Vyasa, son of Parashara, was the author of many of India's prestigious works. Sage Vyasa was a forest-person, who knew the Vedas. The priest and teacher had a large group of disciples and his son. In Vyasa's later life, he had decided to abode at the Himalayas. Vyasa made Puranas (a collection of pieces of a myth, Sanskrit for "ancient"). </p>

			<p class="indent">Then two & a half years later, Vyasa got the idea of a poetic scripture. Since Vyasa couldn't find any other good scribe, Vyasa asked Brahma (the god of birth) to help Vyasa. Brahma then asked Ganesha (the tusked lord) to be the scribe to write Sage Vyasa's poem. Ganesha agreed and wrote out the book. So then the forever immortal Itihasa, The MAHABHARATA, was born.</p>

	<h1><b>The Bird's-Eye Test</b></h1>

<p class="indent">One day, Dronacharya had decided to give another archery lesson to the Pandavas and Kauravas (two cousin groups). Dronacharya had set up a wooden bird on top of a tree. The students had to get ready to aim and fire their arrows at the bird's eye. The Guru Drona wouldn't let his subjects shoot that quickly. Drona wanted to ask each a question before they were ready to shoot. So Drona had asked each Kaurava and Pandava the question: "What do you see?" All had answered: "I see the tree, the leaves, my cousins, you Guru, the sky, and the clouds."</p>

<p class="indent">The teacher had told all to set down their arrows, "you aren't capable of hitting the target." No one knew what Drona wanted. Even Drona's son didn't know the answer. The last one up was Arjuna. Drona had asked with a smile the same question that over and over was said. Arjuna replied with a simple "I only see the eye of the bird." The very pleased Drona gave the command to shoot, and Arjuna got a perfect shot. </p>

<p class="indent">The importance of this story is that it teaches us to focus on the goal only. Not only that, but it tells us to leave out all unnecessary thoughts in the dump. We should never let our minds wander away from our targets. Determination and a strong mindset will help us to achieve our scores. All of Drona's students had wondered why Drona had the favorite student, Arjuna, even though a teacher should never have one. Arjuna had only focused on what the score was.</p>

		<h2><i>My Script</i></h2>
		<h6>Scene 1: ARJUNA: <i>(Arjuna appears from heaven with a flash of light)</i></h6>
                <p>Hello everyone, I had heard that you wanted me to tell you about my childhood experiences. I am Arjuna, the third Pandava, who is the famous one in all the land. Skilled at the bow and arrow, fast like the wind, powerful like the Ganga River, and noble, to my dear cousin/friend Krishna.</p>
		<h6>Scene 2:ARJUNA:</h6>
                <p>For 13 years, my brothers and I were exiled after our evil cousin, Duryodhana, tricked us. My family went to the forest and stayed there for 12 years as a forest-people. I had spent the last year hidden away safely and disguised in the Matsya Kingdom. That is when the Kurukshetra War occurred. After having to suffer for 13 years, I had to make ends meet. I battled courageously along with my siblings to gain back sovereignty in the city of Hastinapura and to get revenge against Duryodhana.</p>
		<h6>Scene 3:ARJUNA:</h6>
                <p>Afterward, my brothers and I won back our honor. 36 years later, I was called by Krishna to take care of his kingdom, Dwaraka, after the Yadava clan created chaos. Then, Krishna had to go to the forest to see Balarama, Krishna's elder brother. Krishna died in the end because of a curse given to Krishna from the Kauravas. Jara, a hunter, had thought of Krishna's weak spot (his foot) as a moving deer and shot an arrow there.</p>
		<h6>Scene 4:ARJUNA:</h6>
		<p>While I was at Dwaraka, the great sage Vyasa had come to tell me that I had to leave the world and reside in heaven. Following Vyasa's order, I then left the mortal world.</p>
		<h6>Scene 5:ARJUNA:</h6>
		<p>Now that I've introduced myself and talked about myself, I will narrate to you a story from my childhood: the day I became the best archer in the world.</p>
		<h6>Scene 6:ARJUNA:</h6>
		<p>Today was important for me, my brothers, and my cousins were to prove their prowess in the Bird's Eye Test. We had to take our weapons (bow and arrow) and be prepared to fire at a wooden bird's eye set up on a tree branch. Guru Drona took turns with students. Before being able to shoot, Guru Drona asked each student the simple question, "What do you see?"</p>
		<h6> Scene 7:ARJUNA:</h6>
		<p>All had answered, "the bird, the tree, the leaves, the sky, the clouds, my brothers, my cousins, and you guru." My teacher told all to set their weapons down and go stand along with the others. I had watched them, perplexed and confused as they were. I knew clearly the answer my guru wanted. With a bright smile on his face, Guru Dronacharya asked the same question to me. Being the last one up, I confidently replied, "the eye of the bird, but not its body." I had my bow at the ready with my arrow pulled back tight. My eyes were so glued to that target, I wouldn't notice my friend Krishna walking around me if he were. Then, the second after my guru gave the order to shoot, I precisely and accurately hit the eye of the bird.</p>
		<h6>Scene 8:ARJUNA:</h6>
		<p>So that was the end of my story. From this reminiscence of my early days, I learned the importance of focus. You have to focus only on the goal or target. Sometimes, other things can distract you. My brothers and cousins thought of objects other than the target. You can only succeed in life if your mind is pointing at the bird's eye. Without focus, you cannot achieve your goals. I had started out worse but soon became good. Why? That is because I never let my mind stay off-focus. My guru had a reason to have a favorite student because other students weren't ready for action. From my experiences, I had succeeded in every battle I fought with this ability.</p>
		<h6>Scene 9:ARJUNA:</h6>
		<p><i>"An Archer is never an archer if he has no goal."</i> You can't have a goal if you aren't determined. I hope you understand this and appreciate what your gurus are doing for you, like how I respect my guru with the desire to reach my aims. I will leave you now but keep my advice in your mind.</p>
