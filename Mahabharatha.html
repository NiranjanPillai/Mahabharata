  <h1>About the Mahabharata</h1>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid"> 
   <p id="about">The Mahabharata is one of India's most prestigious epics with it's amazing stories never heard before. The itihasa (meaning history, which is what the book is about) was first recited at a snake-sacrifice by a student of Vyasa (the author). The series of over 100,000 verses is all about dharma (moral law). It is unbelievably 7 times as long as Homer's Illiad and Odyssey combined. Divided into 18 parvans (sections), the Mahabharata revolves around the ancient world between 400BCE-200CE. Being the 2nd Sanskrit (Sanskrit was the ancient Indic language) epic poem, the text is about two groups of descendants fighting for the rights of the throne for Hastinapura (an ancient city).</p>
<p id="about">There were two groups called the Pandavas (refering to the human personification Pandu) and the Kauravas (human personification of the ancestor Kuru). Vyasa's Mahabharata talks about the exiles of the Pandavas and the evil attitude of Duryodhana, who was the eldest Kaurava with a rivalry against the Pandavas. The Pandavas include the eldest Yudishtira, who was born when Dharma (deity of righteousness) granted a son to Yudhishthira's parents. Bheemasena was born when the deity of the wind, Vayu, came to give a son of strength.The third Pandava, Arjuna, came when Indra the Vedic deity granted Arjuna's parents a child famous in all three worlds (the three worlds is a belief in hinduism). Finally, Naukula and Sahadeva were born from the Ashvins (the twin deities). Altogether, the Pandavas are the heros of the story.</p>

  <h3>Vyasa:The author</h3>

<div class="container-fluid">
   <p id="about">India's most prestegious works were composed by one man. He was Vyasa, the son of Parashara. Vyasa was a sage who resided in the forests and was taught the most important scriptures, the Vedas. The priest and teacher had a son called Shuka, who was also Vyasa's disciple. Vyasa had not only his son as a disciple, but a large group of them who stayed with Vyasa at the Sarasvati river.</p>
<p id="about">In Vyasa's older life, he had decided to abode at the Himalayas where he made Puranas (a collection of pieces of a myth, Sanskrit for "ancient"). Then two & a half years later, Vyasa got the idea of a poetic scripture. Since Vyasa couldn't find any other good scribe, Vyasa asked Bhrama (the god of birth) to help Vyasa. Bhrama then asked Ganesha (the tusked lord) to be the scribe to write Sage Vyasa's poem. Ganesha agreed and wrote out the book. So then the forever immortal Itihasa, The MAHABHARATA, was born.</p>
