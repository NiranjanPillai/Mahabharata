  		<h1><b>About the Mahabharata</b></h1>
		</div>
      
   		<p class="indent">The Mahabharata is one of India's most prestigious epics with it's amazing stories never heard before. The itihasa (meaning history, which is what the book is about) was first recited at a snake-sacrifice by a 	student of Vyasa (the author). The series of over 100,000 verses is all about dharma (moral law). It is unbelievably 7 times as long as Homer's Illiad and Odyssey combined. Divided into 18 parvans (sections), the Mahabharata 	revolves around the ancient world between 400BCE-200CE. Being the 2nd Sanskrit (Sanskrit was the ancient Indic language) epic poem, the text is about two groups of descendants fighting for the rights of the throne for Hastinapura 	(an ancient city).</p>
		<p class="indent">The two groups were called the Pandavas (refering to the human personification Pandu) and the Kauravas (human personification of the ancestor Kuru). Vyasa's Mahabharata talks about the exiles of the Pandavas and 	the evil attitude of Duryodhana, who was the eldest Kaurava with a rivalry against the Pandavas. The Pandavas include the eldest Yudishtira, who was born when Dharma (deity of righteousness) granted a son to Yudhishthira's 	parents. Bheemasena was born when the deity of the wind, Vayu, came to give a son of strength.The third Pandava, Arjuna, came when Indra the Vedic deity granted Arjuna's parents a child famous in all three worlds (the three worlds is a belief in hinduism). Finally, Naukula and Sahadeva were born from the Ashvins (the twin deities). Altogether, the Pandavas are the heros of the story.</p> 
	

			
	 		 <h3><b>Vyasa:The author</b></h3>
		
		
  			<p class="indent">India's most prestegious works were composed by one man. He was Vyasa, the son of Parashara. Vyasa was a sage who resided in the forests and was taught the most important scriptures, the Vedas. The priest and 	teacher had a son called Shuka, who was also Vyasa's disciple. Vyasa had not only his son as a disciple, but a large group of them who stayed with Vyasa at the Sarasvati river.</p>
			<p class="indent">In Vyasa's older life, he had decided to abode at the Himalayas where he made Puranas (a collection of pieces of a myth, Sanskrit for "ancient"). Then two & a half years later, Vyasa got the idea of a poetic 	scripture. Since Vyasa couldn't find any other good scribe, Vyasa asked Bhrama (the god of birth) to help Vyasa. Bhrama then asked Ganesha (the tusked lord) to be the scribe to write Sage Vyasa's poem. Ganesha agreed and wrote 	out the book. So then the forever immortal Itihasa, The MAHABHARATA, was born.</p>

	<h1><b>The Bird's-Eye Test</b></h1>

<p class="indent">One day, Dronacharya had decided to give another archery lesson to the Pandavas and Kauravas. Dronacharya had set up a wooden bird on top of a tree. The students had to get ready to aim and fire their arrows at the bird's eye. The Guru Drona wouldn't let his subjects shoot that quickly, Drona wanted to ask each a question before they were ready to shoot. So Drona had asked each Kaurava and Pandava the question: "What do you see?" All had answered: "I see the tree, the leaves, my cousins, you Guru, the sky, and the clouds."</p>

<p class="indent">The teacher had told all to set down their arrows saying, "you aren't capable of hitting the target." No one knew what Drona wanted, even Drona's son who also came didn't know the answer.The last one up was Arjuna. Drona had asked with a smile the same question that was said over and over. Arjuna replied with a simple "I only see the eye of the bird." The very pleased Drona gave the command to shoot and Arjuna got a perfect shot. </p>

<p class="indent">The importance of this story is that it teaches us to focus on the goal only. Not only that, but it teaches to leave out all unecessary thoughts in the dump. We should never let our minds wander away from our targets. Determination and a strong mind will help us to achieve our scores. All of Drona's students had wondered why Drona had the favourite students, Arjuna, even though a teacher should never have one. This is what is being proved in this story. Arjuna had only focused on what was being said to score for.</p>
