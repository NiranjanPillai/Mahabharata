<h1>The Bird's-Eye Test</h1>

<div class="container-fluid">
<p>One day, Dronacharya had decided to give another archery lesson to the Pandavas and Kauravas. Dronacharya had set up a wooden bird on top of a tree. The students had to get ready to aim and fire their arrows at the bird's eye. The Guru Drona wouldn't let his subjects shoot that quickly, Drona wanted to ask each a question before they were ready to shoot. So Drona had asked each Kaurava and Pandava the question: "What do you see?" All had answered: "I see the tree, the leaves, my cousins, you Guru, the sky, and the clouds."</p>

<p>The teacher had told all to set down their arrows saying, "you aren't capable of hitting the target." No one knew what Drona wanted, even Drona's son who also came didn't know the answer.The last one up was Arjuna. Drona had asked with a smile the same question that was said over and over. Arjuna replied with a simple "I only see the eye of the bird." The very pleased Drona gave the command to shoot and Arjuna got a perfect shot. </p>

<p>The importance of this story is that it teaches us to focus on the goal only. Not only that, but it teaches to leave out all unecessary thoughts in the dump. We should never let our minds wander away from our targets. Determination and a strong mind will help us to achieve our scores. All of Drona's students had wondered why Drona had the favourite students, Arjuna, even though a teacher should never have one. This is what is being proved in this story. Arjuna had only focused on what was being said to score for</p>
